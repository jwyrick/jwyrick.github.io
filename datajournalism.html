		<h3>Obesity in Georgia Counties interactive map</h3>
		<p id="mapexplain">This map shows adult obesity prevalence in counties throughout Georgia, as well as information about other factors that could affect obesity prevalence.
		</p>
		<p id="mapexplain">
		The data for this map comes from the 2014 County Health Rankings Georgia Rankings Data, which can be downloaded at http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/georgia/2014/downloads.
		</p>
		<p id="mapexplain">
		The dataset utilizes data from other sources.
		</p>
		<p id="mapexplain">
		“Obesity prevalence” refers to the percent of adults that report a BMI >= 30. The County Health Rankings dataset cites the source of the data as 2010 data from the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Diabetes Translation.
		</p>
		<p id="mapexplain">
		“Median household income” data comes from the 2012 Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, according to the County Health Rankings dataset.
		</p>
		<p id="mapexplain">
		“Residents with access to exercise opportunities” refers to the percent of the population with adequate access to locations for physical activity. The County Health Rankings dataset cites the source of the data as 2010 and 2012 data from OneSource Global Business Browser, Delorme map data, ESRI, & US Census Tigerline Files.
		</p>
		<p id="mapexplain">
		“Physically inactive residents” refers to the percent of adults aged 20 and over reporting no leisure-time physical activity. The County Health Rankings dataset cites the source of the data as 2010 data from the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Diabetes Translation.
		</p>
		<p id="mapexplain">
		“Residents with limited access to healthy foods” refers to the percentage of the population who are low-income and don’t live near a grocery stored. The County Health Rankings dataset cites the source of the data the 2012 from the USDA Food Environment Atlas.

		<h3>Clayton County: On the road to fitness</h3>
		<p>
		Last November, Bettye Sims brought home turnip greens for Thanksgiving, but she didn’t buy them from the local grocery store. Instead, Sims grew the greens herself in a community garden at the Shelnutt Intergenerational Center, a resource center for grandparents and other relatives in Clayton County raising children in parent absent homes. Not only does Sims enjoy taking home the fresh veggies she grows, but she also likes the activity working the garden provides.
		</p>
		<p>
		“The elderly seniors … we all get old, and we have arthritis,” Sims said. [It] helps us with exercising.” 
		</p>
		<p>
		The community garden Sims tends is an example of Clayton County’s efforts to encourage fitness and healthy eating. The county currently has the highest adult obesity rate in the ten-county area governed by the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC), according to data from this year’s County Health Rankings. Most of the surrounding counties, such as Fayette, Fulton and Henry, have between 20 and 30 percent obese residents, while Clayton County’s obesity rate is 36 percent, tailed closely by Douglas County at 35 percent. A variety of factors may contribute – from lack of access to healthy foods to lower physical activity – but Clayton County leaders have plans to continue addressing the issue through efforts such as community gardens and health education programs.
		</p>
		<p>
		“It’s a combination of things,” said Kim Riley, Clayton County’s Cooperative Extension Coordinator, of the factors contributing to the county’s obesity rate. “I think we have a lower median income, but then again it’s also a lack of [nutrition] education and access [to healthy foods].”
		</p>
		<p>
		Clayton County’s median income was $37,594 in 2012, compared to the other counties under the ARC, which include Cherokee, Cobb, Dekalb Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinett, Henry and Rockdale.  These counties ranged from $49,061 in Dekalb to $78,717 in Fayette, according to County Health Ranking data.
		</p>
		<p>
		Riley thinks food deserts – areas where residents don’t have easy access to grocery stores with fresh, healthy food – could also contribute to the obesity rate. According to the County Health Ranking data, 14 percent of Clayton’s residents have limited access to healthy food, which is a higher percentage than the other nine ARC counties. Clayton County’s bus system, C-TRAN, was shut down in 2010, leaving residents without public transit that might have helped them reach this healthy food.
		</p>
		<p>
		“There are some people who probably have a harder time getting to a grocery store,” said Joel Hall, public information officer for the Clayton County Board of Health. “[If] people are down the street from Long John Silvers ... and it’s a little closer than Kroger, they might use that option more often.”
		</p>
		<p>
		Clayton County also has the second highest percentage of physically inactive adults in the nine-county area, at 28 percent, despite having a higher percentage of residents with access to recreation facilities than many of the surrounding counties, according to the County Health Ranking data.
		</p>
		<p>
		The county’s focus on community gardens could be one answer to these problems – namely those of healthy food access and physical inactivity.
		</p>
		<p>
		“It’s a good low-impact exercise,” Hall said of residents tending to vegetables in a community garden. “It gives [people] more familiarity with foods that are healthy … it also gives people kind of greater personal responsibility over the food they eat.”
		</p>
		<p>
		Though community gardens have existed in Clayton County for years, Riley said she thinks there’s been a recent push for more. Riley said Clayton County Extension has been involved in advising or setting up about 17 community gardens in the past few years.
		</p>
		<p>
		Many of the gardens are located at Clayton County’s parks or on other public property similar to the Shelnutt Intergenerational Center’s garden, according to Hall. The challenge is finding space for community gardens in neighborhoods, Riley said.
		</p>
		<p>
		Mobile farmers markets may be another way Clayton County can increase access to healthy food and decrease obesity. Fulton County Extension has used refurbished county vehicles to take fruits and vegetables into areas identified as food deserts, according to Riley, who would be interested in creating a similar program for Clayton County.  
		</p>
		<p>
		County organizations such as Clayton County Extension and the Clayton County Board of Health, also offer a variety of other nutrition education and fitness programs, such a cooking school for senior citizens. However, Riley thinks uniting efforts through a countywide health council could make sure programs targeted all segments of the community throughout the year.
