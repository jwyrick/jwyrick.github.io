		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<h3>I am a freelance science and health writer currently completing the health and medical journalism graduate program at the University of Georgia. I have a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from Asbury University, and I’ve interned as a science writer at Fermilab, a U.S. national particle physics lab, and Alltech, a global animal health and nutrition company.
I’ve also worked as an assistant lab technician in the department of plant and soil sciences at the University of Kentucky. I’m fascinated by the intricacies of science and write to provide both scientific and lay audiences with useful, engaging stories.</h3>
